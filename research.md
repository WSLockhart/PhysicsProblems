Previously I worked on *pulsars* - rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit a characteristic pattern of electromagnetic radiation in radio and x-rays. Together with professors [Sam Gralla](http://w3.physics.arizona.edu/people/sam-gralla) and [Dimitrios Psaltis](http://xtreme.as.arizona.edu/~dpsaltis/), I am using computer simulations to model the radiation emitted by these stars. Hidden in these light curves are clues to the mysteries of the neutron star interior, and the nature of ultra-dense matter beyond the nuclear saturation density. By comparing our models with new observational data from NASA's [NICER](https://www.nasa.gov/nicer) mission, we hope to improve the known constraints on the size, magnetic field, and other fundamental properties of these astounding objects.
